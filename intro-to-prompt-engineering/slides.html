<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">It turns out that if you create a system for predicting the <b>next word</b> and train it over a dataset as big as, for example, the Internet&#x2026;</li>
<li class="fragment appear">It gets really good at providing answers to questions.</li>

<p>
You might be asking "Why should I care? I have seen 2001 Space Odyssey. I know how the song goes" but it does get better.
</p>

<p>
Why should I use XTDB?
</p>

<p>
It makes sense. You have trained it to guess what comes next and What usually comes after a question? An answer.
</p>

<p>
I believe GPT-4 has had some bonus training to specifically teach it about questions to give it an extra boost over other LLMs.

<h2 id="org8cb6feb">What is Prompt Engineering?</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment appear">Prompt engineering (or Proompting) is creating concise prompts designed to get the best from LLMs like ChatGPT</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Smaller prompts means faster and cheaper prompts</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Fewer responses means faster and cheaper responses</li>
<li class="fragment appear">ChatGPT is a conversational agent so if you don't get what you want first time, you can always ask it to make tweaks and modifications until you do</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Prompt engineering aims to reduce these iterations, especially for repeated requests</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
I am not going to use the word Proompting and you cannot make me.
</p>

<p>
You're generally trying to get the best result with the fewest tokens. I could go into the detail of tokens, but for ease of use, think of tokens as words or parts of words for uncommon words.
</p>

<p>
Example of using iterations with ChatGPT is that the css file that provides the colours, fonts, spacing, etc for this presentation were all generated by ChatGPT, and I was a terrible person to be designing a css for. Me and my buddy ChatGPT spent 15 minutes with me telling it the topic of my talk and then me saying "Maybe a little lighter&#x2026; Maybe a little darker&#x2026; Could you add a gradient" then I eventually said "What if we threw away all your hard work and I got you to start all over again with this colour scheme."

By far, one of my favourite things to do in this category is get a response from ChatGPT and then say "Critique your last response and make improvements". You can run this repeatedly and you'll find that it really does get better and better. It works with code and prose.

We can have fun with our favourite actors, writers, or books. But we can also be more practical with instructions that make ChatGPT much more helpful. Sometimes, I've found ChatGPT be a little sassy if I ask it to be something silly and the sassiness disappears if I tell it to "pretend" to be something else, but your milage may vary.

I recently used this to get GPT4 to write me a murder mystery story summary. I made sure to ask it to give a step-by-step guide to how the detective solved the crime&#x2026; to make sure that it was actually solvable reasonably, rather than just being CSI level random. (Apologies to CSI fans, I also have spent far too much time watching science montages)

<p>
The data source could be your database, an API some documentation or the effect of running some code.

<p>
One thing I have been doing with RAG recently is taking a prompt from a user, feeding it into GPT to give me output in a format I can process easier in my code, then executing that code to retrieve the data, then sending it back into GPT augmented.

Learnprompting is an excellent resource I discovered after finishing this presentation, unfortunately, but it has interactive labs you can run.
David Shapiro has an excellent YouTube channel that covers a lot of the more complex theory of Prompt Engineering but always with practical code you can see in action.
